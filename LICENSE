THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS FOR 
DISPLAYCLUSTER

These license terms are an agreement between the University of Texas at Austin 
(UT) and you. Please read them. They apply to the pre-release software named 
above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms 
also apply to any UT updates and support for this software, unless other terms 
accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO 
NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 

*	You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your 
premises solely to evaluate and test the software. 
*	These license terms do not grant you any distribution rights.

2.	TERM. The term of this agreement is two months. At the termination of 
this agreement, you agree to delete or otherwise destroy all copies of the 
pre-release software, including all pre-release updates.

3.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. This software is a pre-release version. It may 
not work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the 
final version. We also may not release a final version.

4.	FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to UT, you give to 
UT, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in 
any way and for any purpose.  You will not give feedback that is subject to a 
license that requires UT to license its software or documentation to third 
parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this 
agreement.

5.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement 
only gives you some rights to use the software. UT reserves all other rights. 
Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may 
use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, 
you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow 
you to use it in certain ways. You may not

*	disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any 
third party without UT prior written approval;
*	work around any technical limitations in the software;
*	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and 
only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this 
limitation;
*	make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or 
allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
*	publish the software for others to copy;
*	rent, lease or lend the software;
*	transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
*	use the software for commercial software hosting services.

6.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide 
support services for it.

7.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, 
updates and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the 
software and support services.

8.	APPLICABLE LAW. Texas state law governs the interpretation of this 
agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, 
including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, 
and in tort.

9.  	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the 
risk of using it. UT gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You 
may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement 
cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, UT excludes the 
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and 
non-infringement.
